<ol type = 1>
<li>Firstly insert a 4gb (or more)  storage pendrive to ur laptop.Make sure u have removed all of its data and put somewhere because the <b><u><i>PENDRIVE WILL BE FORMATTED!</i></u></b></li>
<li>Next install latest ubuntu pendrive bootable OS from the official website ONLY!</li>
<li>Now at the same time install YUMI software from<a href = "https://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/">YUMI website</a>...
<li>After the installation of all the required things, run the YUMI software and follow the below procedures:</li>
<ul type = disk>

	<li>Select FreeDos as boot and select the iso file by clicking <font color = white>SELECT</font></li>
	<li>Now dont go to change anything else[Next 2 options down there are by default] </li>
	<li>Click on start button</li>
	<li>Click Yes to all dialogue boxes and select the recommended options!{Do not select the DD convertion but Select the ISO **conversion option**}</li>
	<li>It will take about 5-10 minutes to complete the setup...If u want to put another OS to ur pendrive, u can click yes when YUMI asks u else no..I am selecting "no"</li>

	<li>Then select the name that starts with "Linux..."</li>
	<li>Now select ubuntu from the list</li>
	<li>Then select first option[i.e. the name that DOESN'T have any extras like the shortest name among the 2]</li>
	<li>Then it starts a command line type and then scans ur drive for errors[better to allow the process to complete]</li>
